# Operating Systems Revision Notes

I'm trying to make some revision notes for the VU Operating Systems course for 2017. If you want to be added as a collaborator, [send me an email](mailto:github-contact@jacobsburley.com). This document is written in LaTeX, and is automatically compiled and deployed to [releases](https://github.com/jc0b/OperatingSystems/releases) by [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org).
